## \_\_Keyboard Capturer\(Spy what the other one is typing\)


</div>

### Description

This code captures all the keys that are pressed on the remote machine and sends its scancode to the server. It displays you the keys pressed in understandable manner. The best usage of it is to spy the others computer and to get passwords(Except login password). For that only I have created it. Kindly vote my code
 
### More Info
 
null

you should be familiar with the Windows Hooks. B'coz I have used windows keyboard hooks in my program. And a little bit of knowledge in Winsock control.
